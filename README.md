the motivation of this project is to see if there is any part of the modern sense of humor (at least in my circles) that actually requires human creation or if humor can be found in anyting, espcially and specifically if its random.

the program will randomly generate a word from a list of words and search it on google images. It will then pick an image at random. Next it will again generate a word or string of words and add it onto image in a meme format. The product will not be touched or manipulated by human eye and will be presented to a group.
